# STRATEGIC CONTEXT BACKUP - 2025-06-06
# Critical Decision Point: Testing-Focused vs Safety-Focused Direction

## DEVIL'S ADVOCATE KEY FINDING
Built safe failing system instead of reliable succeeding system

## ORIGINAL VISION (Lost Focus)
- Comprehensive testing suite to prevent AI code degradation
- Puppeteer + DesktopCommander integration  
- Quality gates to catch AI blind spots
- Testing was supposed to BE the solution

## CURRENT REALITY (What We Built)
- Development safety system (workflow protection)
- Session continuity and monitoring
- Never break main project
- Testing "quietly less emphasized"

## CORE PROBLEMS STILL UNSOLVED
1. AI claims code works but it's actually broken
2. No real validation of AI's work  
3. Local works but production fails
4. Code degradation over time
5. Context window limitations and hard session ends

## CRITICAL DECISION POINT
Should we pivot back to original testing-focused vision or continue current path?

## MISSING TOOLS FOR ORIGINAL VISION
- validate_code_quality (mandatory before sync)
- Comprehensive testing suite integration
- Progressive deployment pipeline
- Real environment testing with Puppeteer/DesktopCommander

## SESSION PRESERVATION TEST
This file tests whether strategic context can survive MCP server resets

## RECOVERY PATH
1. load_session_state() 
2. Read this backup for full context
3. Continue from decision point
4. Sandbox: F:\dev-safety-mcp-sandbox-monitoring-enhancements
